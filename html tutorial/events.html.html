<h3>FOOTBALL</h3>
<p>India vs Uzbekistan AFC Asian 2023 Live Score: Well a rather disappointing end to a match that was pulsating in the first half and for much of the second. Both sides were going through the motions really in extra time and the referee actually blew the whistle about three seconds before the five-minute mark. India yet to score in this tournament but they did come oh so close a couple of times in this match. But let's face it, they could not sustain the kind of pressure needed to make it look like the Uzbek defence was too bothered at any point in the game. That late third goal in the first half was probably too hard a blow for India to recover from. It did come against the run of play somewhat, India were looking good towards the end of the first half. There is still this little thread of a chance for India to go through to the knockouts and so for now, see you until the next match, which is against Syria on January 23.
